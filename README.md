Lithium-ion battery ( Li-ion or LIB ) includes cylindrical steel shell and square aluminum shell. The anode materials include lithium cobalt carbonate, lithium manganese carbonate, lithium iron phosphate, nickel cobalt manganese and nickel cobalt aluminum.

Nickel–metal hydride battery (NiMH or Ni-MH) is a type of rechargeable battery with good performance. It divides into high voltage and low voltage. NiMH have replaced NiCd for many roles, notably small rechargeable batteries.

Lithium-Polymer battery( LiPo or LIP ) is a rechargeable battery whose electrolyte is solid. Pack with Aluminum plastic film. Compared with Li-ion , it is higher energy density, more miniaturization, ultra-thin, lightweight, and high safety.
